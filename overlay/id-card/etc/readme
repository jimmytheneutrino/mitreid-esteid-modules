To setup id-card support for the app, you'll need to configure the first server the user connects to 
(generally the loadbalancer: apache/nginx) to require client certificate from the brower.

For the server to know which client certificates to even ask for, you'll need to give the server a list of ca certificates 
(current sk CA-s are in id_ca.crt file, this can be used as is in apache).

To configure apache for id-card, setup ssl in apache first, then configure the following in ssl vhost (on port 443):

# point apache to the list of allowed client certificate CA certs.
SSLCACertificateFile "conf/ssl/id_ca.crt"

# tell apache to require client certificate at the applications /idlogin path. 
  <Location /<oidc_path>/idlogin*>
    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
    SSLVerifyClient optional
    SSLVerifyDepth  2
    SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{SSL:SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY} !^SUCCESS$
    RewriteRule .* /oidc/login?error=idcard [R,L]
  </Location>



For backend validation of id-card certificate to work, the server needs access to sk ocsp service (ocsp.sk.ee) and a valid jdigidoc.cfg reference in oidc.properties:

esteid.jdigidoc.config=/path/to/jdigidoc-prod.cfg
